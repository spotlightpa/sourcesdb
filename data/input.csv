My cognates in economics, sociology, and biostatistics have deeply influenced the types of questions and methods I typically employ. These methods primarily deal with issues of selection based on observables and unobservables, lack of dependence given participants’ connections (either to one another or based on their common exposure to living in a given place). Accordingly, I have been using weighting methods, instrumental variables, network, and spatial statistical analyses along with data visualization techniques to address most of my research questions. Some outlets of this research have included Economics of Education Review, American Educational Research Journal, and higher education research journals such as the Journal of Higher Education, Research in Higher Education, and the Review of Higher Education.

She is a Co-Founder and Board Member of Erie's Black Wall Street; as well as a trained birth doula with emphasis on community advocacy. 
In 2019, she was the first open black-woman to run for a City Council seat in Erie, PA on a wide platform of creating a more livable city for all. The greatest focus being on the lack of representation in positions of power in city/council government. “You can't be; what you can’t see” and with Black people making up 16.7% of the population in the City of Erie; it was imperative to highlight that. Even though she did not win the seat, she is able to align her goals with EBWS’ mission to serve as a vehicle for change and empowerment of Erie’s Black community through cultivating meaningful relationships, education of members, the creation of social networks and the promotion of Black entrepreneurship. Davona was recently appointed as a commissioner for the PA Commission on LGBT Affairs. 
This past summer she became a trained birth doula and reiki 2 practitioner and working towards certification; she also co-created Hearth Folk Collective with a friend to create a brave space for healers of all backgrounds. 
Lastly, she collaborated with other local activists and a film director and launched the Our Erie Series (podcast); which will bring citizens, entrepreneurs, activists, politicians and thought leaders together for a frank discussion around societal issues facing the post-industrial city of Erie, Pennsylvania and the United States at large. 
When she is not championing for the change, Davona enjoys hanging with her wife, friends and family, loves to braid hair, loves music, reiki, meditation, reading a good book, and plants.

We are a concert performance venue who focuses on promoting and supporting local talent. Our shows, such as the Prince Tribute and the 90’s R&B show, have amassed standing room only crowds. We are providing a live band, house background singers and a “lounge atmosphere”, staples found in indie-scenes in bigger, more well known cities, and now offered right here in Central Pennsylvania. We believe we have identified a market, one that could change how people view Harrisburg entertainment. In addition to providing a great show, we provide a platform for local soul singers, one that has otherwise been lacking locally. We have had over 45 singers added to our list of alumni performers and counting.

Airis Smallwood is local arts enthusiast who created The Singer’s Lounge after being dissatisfied with a lack of performance venues. Growing tired of “karaoke” and wedding performances being the only outlet, The Singer’s Lounge was her way of reviving the area’s enthusiasm for supporting local and independent artists. She’s been singing professionally for 15 years, has sang background and been the opening act for many successful R&B and gospel performers. Most recently she performed along with other notable The Singer’s Lounge Alumni at the Dauphin County Cultural Fest which draws in hundreds of people and is one of the area’s most well-attended events.

Professor Sibley’s scholarship focuses on criminal law and procedure, as informed by critical legal and critical race theory. She is particularly interested in seeking out places where making relatively small procedural or administrative interventions can produce substantial substantive benefits to criminal defendants and the criminal legal system. Her interests grow out of her practice as an appellate criminal defense attorney, investigations of overlooked areas of procedural discrimination, and a scholarly concern with engaging in subject areas that will both center and amplify the interests of traditionally marginalized and disenfranchised communities.

Before joining the faculty of Temple Law, Professor Sibley was an acting assistant professor and the Associate Director of Lawyering at New York University School of Law. Prior to entering legal academia, she was an appellate public defender representing indigent criminal defendants on direct appeal and collateral proceedings in New York City. Her earlier experience includes litigation and transactional practice at two international law firms, and a clerkship for the Honorable Eric L. Clay of the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit.

Professor Sibley received a B.A. in Comparative Literature from New York University, an M.A. from The University of Chicago, and a J.D. from New York University School of Law. In 2019, she was awarded the Podell Distinguished Teaching Award by NYU School of Law.",https://drive.google.com/open?id=1GPLCPSS9SBGMYTTK8uZbWCfvIqLvXVrP,"Philadelphia, PA",,,,,,,,"CIVIL RIGHTS, CRIMINAL JUSTICE, LAW","Criminal law, incarceration, collateral consequences, prisons, jails, crimes",,Prof.
