  "bio": "Cristina Jo P\u00e9rez studies the violence of US immigration policy and practices.  Her current book project, On Border Time: Chrononationalism and the Rise of the Border Industrial Complex, traces the state\u2019s discourses of national (un)belonging, its acts of harm against Mexican migrants, and its commitments to private interests in border policing. Her teaching and research interests include Latinx studies, border and immigration studies, queer of color critique, and temporality studies. She came to F&M after having served as a National Center for Institutional Diversity Research Postdoctoral Fellow in Women\u2019s Studies at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, the Mellon/ACLS Visiting Assistant Professor in Comparative Border Studies at the University of California, Davis, and a SHASS Diversity Predoctoral Fellow in Women\u2019s Studies at MIT. Cristina has a PhD in Women's Studies from the University of Maryland, College Park. She was raised in El Paso, Texas.",
