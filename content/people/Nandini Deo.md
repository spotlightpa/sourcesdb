  "bio": "Nandini Deo is Associate Professor in the Department of Political Science at Lehigh University. Her research is at the intersection of religion, feminism, and social movements in South Asia. Professor Deo\u2019s first book, The Politics of Collective Advocacy in India, was co-authored with Duncan McDuie Ra, and focused on the gains of NGOs networking transnationally. Her second book, Mobilizing Religion and Gender in India: The role of activism, compares the rise and fall of women\u2019s movements and religious nationalism as an outcome of activist strategies as they responded to changing political structures. She is currently working on two projects. One is a collaboration with scholars in India and the Netherlands to investigate the ways in which civil society organizations in India engage in political advocacy today. The other maps how collaboration between corporations and non-governmental organizations in India is reshaping the development sector.",
