  "bio": "I have always had an interest in the arts of all mediums. Growing up with a mother that was an illustrator, graphic designer, and art director, and a father that was skilled with photography, I was bound to have a tad bit of creativity flowing through my genes. I grew up wanting to be an artist of any sort\u2026 an illustrator, a painter, a graphic designer (which I am now).\n\nWithin these past 4 years, I have also recently discovered a passion for makeup artistry. Makeup art has brought me such life, passion, self-confidence, and an entirely new platform to explore my creative freedom.\n\nI must say, art is my way of life and my way to express myself. So many possibilities and un-ventured avenues I could run wild with! My work is an extension of me to you.\n\nRemember...\nBe Unique\nBe Weird\nBe Creative\nand...\nBe You!",
