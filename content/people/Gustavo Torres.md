  "bio": "Executive Director Gustavo Torres oversees the largest Latino and immigrant organization in the Mid-Atlantic, which works in Pennsylvania, Maryland, and Virginia. He is nationally and internationally recognized for his leadership and vision in the immigrant rights movement in the United States. Gustavo came to the United States due to the political and economic unrest in his country of origin, Colombia. He joined CASA\u2019s staff as a community organizer and became CASA's executive director in 1994. Under his leadership, CASA has grown from a small social service organization with a handful of staff members to a nationally awarded, multiservice, advocacy, organizing and support agency with a staff of nearly 150 and a membership of over 97,000, which operates in multiple states including Maryland, Virginia and Pennsylvania. Gustavo has spearheaded several ambitious campaigns locally, statewide, and nationally. Gustavo helped to lead CASA in 2012 to pass the Maryland DREAM act, which provided in-state tuition to undocumented students. He has established Welcome Centers that have served as a model for organizations across the nation and lead efforts to allow all Maryland drivers to obtain a driver license, regardless of status. CASA and its partners helped to increase the minimum wage in Maryland, Prince George\u2019s County, Montgomery County, and Baltimore City. Most recently, he helped to pass housing protections for tenants in Montgomery County and Police Accountability legislation in Maryland. He also served as a member of multiple transition teams for city Mayors, state Governors and County Executives and on numerous task forces and leadership groups addressing issues of diversity, immigrant rights, and multiculturalism.",
