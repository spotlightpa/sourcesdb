  "bio": "Erec Smith is an associate professor of rhetoric at York College of Pennsylvania and a writing fellow for Heterodox Academy. His latest book, A Critique of Anti-Racism in Rhetoric and Composition: The Semblance of Empowerment, was recently published by Lexington Press. Dr. Smith's interests mainly focus on the manifestations of anti-racism in contemporary America. Generally, Smith believes many current anti-racism initiatives operate from a place of minority disempowerment. Hence, Smith argues for a more empowering form of anti-racism.  Also, Smith moderates the Rhetoric and Composition subgroup of the Heterodox Academy, an organization that promotes \"open inquiry, viewpoint diversity, and constructive disagreement.\" Along with books, Smith has been published in several academic journals and has had op-eds published in USA Today, Newsweek, RealClearPolitics, The Washington Examiner, and regional outlets like Pennlive and the York Daily Record. Other interests include the connection of rhetorical theory to Buddhist philosophy, political rhetoric, and activist rhetoric.",
