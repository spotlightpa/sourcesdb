She believes in taking care of her guests both internally and externally. This also leads to the community mindset. She does small business consulting, sits on the board of the Pittsburgh Metropolitan Area Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, and is currently the Program Manager for Community Health at Allegheny Health Network. She also volunteers her time as the Pittsburgh area Grow With Google coach and as the program manager for #ATU Athletic Trauma Unit, a non-profit organization focused on food insecurity and removing barriers families have to living a healthy lifestyle.",
