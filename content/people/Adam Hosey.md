  "bio": "Adam Hosey is an abolitionist educator, Philly nationalist, and sandwich connoisseur who lives in Lancaster, Pennsylvania. He was born in Busan, South Korea, and after two years in orphanages was adopted by an Italian family in the Philadelphia suburbs. \n\nAs an educator, Adam has spent his career developing and practicing liberatory pedagogy for his students and school environments and believes that schools should teach students how to be empowered rather than how to assimilate into oppressor culture. He was a founding teacher at the number one high school in Pennsylvania, and created the history and philosophy curriculum from the ground up and took great joy and pride teaching about systemic oppression to the vastly white students in that school. \n\nMost recently Adam has been working in the demographically opposite Harrisburg School District. There he advocated for, created, and teaches courses in black history and feminist history. He also started and leads the district Equity Team. With a grant he won from the Southern Equity Foundation, Adam was able to participate in Racial Justice Institutes and a Train the Trainers with Cultural Bridges to Justice starting in 2018, and works with the YWCA Lancaster as the training coordinator for the Center for Racial and Gender Equity.\n\nAdam graduated from the Schreyer Honors College of Penn State University with degrees in history and film, where he played soccer and was a competitive ballroom dancer. He is currently working on his doctorate in educational leadership at Shippensburg University. \n\nAside from teaching and learning, Adam enjoys cooking, having strong opinions about pop culture, and carpentry. He has coached soccer and baseball for over ten years and is a father of two. His oldest, Dylan, is named after Bob Dylan. He and his partner Emily also have two cats named Reuben and Monte Cristo, who are named after sandwiches.",
