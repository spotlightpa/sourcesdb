NPP centers the youth, immigrant communities and communities of color in rural, urban, and suburban Pennsylvania to transform and expand the electorate in the Commonwealth. \n\nKadida is a tireless advocate for social and economic justice issues and is motivated to empower and excite the electorate to enthusiastically vote in every election -- all the way down the entire ballot. In addition to working on voting rights, Kadida also serves as co-chair of Why Courts Matter - Pennsylvania, an advocacy campaign seeking to protect the independence of our state and federal courts, and educate the electorate about their importance. The Temple University graduate resides in the Philly suburbs and counts civil rights organizing icon, and West Chester, Pennsylvania native Bayard Rustin as her hero.",
