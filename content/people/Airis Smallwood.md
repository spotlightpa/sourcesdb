  "bio": "The Singer\u2019s Lounge is a unique and creative approach to urban nightlife in Harrisburg, PA. We are a concert performance venue who focuses on promoting and supporting local talent. Our shows, such as the Prince Tribute and the 90\u2019s R&B show, have amassed standing room only crowds. We are providing a live band, house background singers and a \u201clounge atmosphere\u201d, staples found in indie-scenes in bigger, more well known cities, and now offered right here in Central Pennsylvania. We believe we have identified a market, one that could change how people view Harrisburg entertainment. In addition to providing a great show, we provide a platform for local soul singers, one that has otherwise been lacking locally. We have had over 45 singers added to our list of alumni performers and counting.\n\nAiris Smallwood is local arts enthusiast who created The Singer\u2019s Lounge after being dissatisfied with a lack of performance venues. Growing tired of \u201ckaraoke\u201d and wedding performances being the only outlet, The Singer\u2019s Lounge was her way of reviving the area\u2019s enthusiasm for supporting local and independent artists. She\u2019s been singing professionally for 15 years, has sang background and been the opening act for many successful R&B and gospel performers. Most recently she performed along with other notable The Singer\u2019s Lounge Alumni at the Dauphin County Cultural Fest which draws in hundreds of people and is one of the area\u2019s most well-attended events. Airis Smallwood is a native of Harrisburg, PA and has been very active in her community and in many humanitarian efforts through the arts.",
