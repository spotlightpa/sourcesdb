  "bio": "I am an assistant professor at the Graduate School of Social Work and Social Research at Bryn Mawr College. I have completed doctoral studies in social work at WUSTL, and a post-doc in health research at RU. My area of research is pediatric suicidal behaviors, with a focus on suicide disparities across racial, ethnic, socioeconomic, and gender dimensions. I use intersectional approaches to understand how the accumulations of disadvantage results in suicidal behaviors in youth ages 7 to 20 in the United States and Latin America. \n\nIn addition to my role as a faculty, I am a co-founder of the Youth Suicide Research Consortium (https://www.youthsuicideresearch.org), an interdisciplinary network of researchers dedicated to the study of youth suicidal behavior among diverse populations (i.e., diversity based on race, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, gender, sexual orientation, and ability), with an emphasis on understanding and decreasing disparities.\n\nBuilding on my bicultural skills (Latina immigrant to the US), and work takes place in the US and Latin America. In Latin America, I am very interested in helping providers working in low resource settings with very vulnerable individuals, to access quality training about how to improve services.",
